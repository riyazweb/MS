            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have brought about the development of Sora AI, an AI text-to-video software that can create realistic videos within minutes. This software has the ability to understand the laws of physics and emotions, generating videos that are indistinguishable from real-life footage. The technology uses "visual patches" to analyze and create videos, offering a significant improvement over previous AI tools. While there are currently minor flaws in AI-generated videos, the speed of technological advancement suggests that these will soon be undetectable by the human eye. Sora AI is currently being subjected to security testing before its public release, as it poses potential risks for spreading fake news and manipulating videos of real people. However, despite these concerns, AI-generated videos are already being exploited for fraudulent purposes, such as promoting betting apps using fake celebrity endorsements.</p>
