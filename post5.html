            <p>AI-powered coding assistance is becoming prevalent, leading to speculation about the future of human coding. Industry experts like the CEO of Nvidia believe that AI will eliminate the need for traditional programming, as it will allow non-programmers to create software easily. Some believe this shift will occur within the next five years, with AI assistants taking over the majority of coding tasks.

Throughout history, coding languages have evolved to become more accessible, making it easier for people to create code. AI assistants represent the latest layer of abstraction in this progression, further simplifying the process and allowing a wider range of individuals to participate in software development.

While AI is currently a powerful coding assistant, it still faces challenges in handling large-scale projects and maintaining code context. However, rapid advancements are addressing these issues, and it is believed that AI will eventually excel at coding tasks, leaving humans to focus on problem-solving, design, and user experience aspects of software development.</p>
