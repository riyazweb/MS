            <p>The Nothing Phone 2A is a budget-friendly offering from Nothing, similar to the Pixel A series or iPhone SE series. Despite using plastic on the frame, it retains its eye-catching design with the transparent back and Glyph lights.

Powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chip, it offers improved performance over the original Nothing Phone 1. Its 50MP main camera and 50MP ultrawide camera provide decent photo quality, although consistency can be an issue.

The phone comes with Android 14 out of the box, featuring widgets on the lock screen and improved connectivity. However, it has experienced some bugs that have been addressed through software updates.

With a 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED display, 5000mAh battery, and 45W fast charging, the Nothing Phone 2A offers competitive hardware specifications in its price range around 25,000 Rupees.</p>
