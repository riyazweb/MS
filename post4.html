            <p>Black holes are immense reservoirs of energy, but their immense gravity traps energy permanently. However, spinning black holes create an ergosphere where space and time are distorted. By entering the ergosphere and exchanging mass-energy with the black hole, objects can gain rotational energy. This "cheat code" allows civilizations to extract energy from black holes. One method involves dropping objects into the ergosphere to trade mass-energy for rotational energy. Another technique utilizes a mirror to amplify electromagnetic waves through superradiant scattering within the ergosphere. This energy can be harnessed as a virtually endless power source or detonated as an incredibly powerful black hole bomb, potentially providing a lifeline for civilizations in a dying universe.</p>
